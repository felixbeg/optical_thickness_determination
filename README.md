# Optical Thickness Determination
In this repository you will find calibration measurements for the optical thickness determination of hBN. Furthermore the programs with which the calibration was executed and the finally applied program are included. 

Note that the calibration is only valid for the setup with which the measurements were made. The programs however can be used to make new calibrations or to evaluate already measured calibrations.
