# Optical Thickness Determination
In this repository you will find programs for calibrating and using the optical thickness determination of hBN. 

The calibration measurements and fit parameters can be taken from:
  
  https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/FHt0AqcyQLUPlyR

For using the programs with the Lucid Vision Labs camera, you will also need to install the arena_api modules included in the sciebo folder. 

Note that the calibration is only valid for the setup with which the measurements were made. The programs however can be used to make new calibrations or to evaluate already measured calibrations.
