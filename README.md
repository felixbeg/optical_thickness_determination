# Optical Thickness Determination
In this repository you will find programs for calibrating and using the optical thickness determination of hBN. 

The calibration measurements and fit parameters can be taken from:

Note that the calibration is only valid for the setup with which the measurements were made. The programs however can be used to make new calibrations or to evaluate already measured calibrations.
